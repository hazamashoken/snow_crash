There is a app called level08 that prints the contents of a file. There is also a file called "token" that contains the password for flag08. We don't have permission to read "token" and the level08 app will not read files called "token". We created a symbolic link in /tmp:

ln -s ~/token /tmp/test

Then called the level08 app to read the contents of the link:

./level08 /tmp/test

This returns quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean which is the password for flag08.
