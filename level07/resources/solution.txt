There is a file in the home directory called level07. This file runs as flag07 and calls "/bin/echo $LOGNAME". By changing the LOGNAME ENV variable we can force thr app to run /bin/getflag as the flag07 user.

First we changed the LOGNAME variable:

export LOGNAME=';getflag'

Or we can use back ticks:

export LOGNAME='`getflag`'

This results in printing the level07 flag. There is no password for flag07.
