There is a file in the home directory called "level03". The permissions on the file are:

-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

The "rws" permission means that the file runs as the user "flag03". This program tries to call echo to print "Explout me". we changed the PATH using this command:

export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

This adds /tmp to the front of PATH and means calling echo will search /tmp first. We added a script called "echo" in /tmp that calls /bin/getflag. Running "level03" searches /tmp first and calls our script before the real echo command. This shows the flag for level04. There is no password for flag03.
